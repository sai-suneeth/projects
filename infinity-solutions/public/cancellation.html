            <h1>Cancellation and Refund Policy</h1>
            <p>Last Updated: 20-Aug-2024</p>
            <p>At Kaboom Gaming, we strive to provide a seamless and enjoyable gaming experience for all our users. To maintain the quality and availability of our services, we have implemented the following cancellation and refund policy.</p>

            <h2>1. Cancellation Policy</h2>
            <h3>1.1. No Cancellations</h3>
            <p>Once a booking is confirmed on our website, it cannot be cancelled. All bookings are final and non-cancellable.</p>
            <h3>1.2. Careful Selection</h3>
            <p>We encourage you to carefully select your preferred time slot before finalizing your booking as changes or cancellations cannot be accommodated once the booking is completed.</p>

            <h2>2. Refund Policy</h2>
            <h3>2.1. Company-Initiated Refunds</h3>
            <p>If Kaboom Gaming is unable to provide the booked service due to unforeseen circumstances such as technical issues, unavailability of the PS5 console, or other operational disruptions, you will be eligible for a full refund of the amount paid for the affected booking.</p>
            <h3>2.2. Refund Process</h3>
            <p>In the event of a company-initiated refund, we will notify you via email and initiate the refund process. Refunds will be processed to the original payment method used during booking. Please allow up to 7-10 business days for the refund to reflect in your account, depending on your payment provider’s processing times.</p>
            <h3>2.3. No Refund for User-Initiated Requests</h3>
            <p>Refunds will not be provided for any user-initiated requests such as no-shows or personal reasons for not utilizing the booking.</p>

            <h2>3. Dispute Resolution</h2>
            <h3>3.1. Contact Us</h3>
            <p>If you believe you are entitled to a refund under this policy and have not received it, please contact our customer support team at kaboomgamingfun@gmail.com within 7 days of your booking date.</p>
            <h3>3.2. Response Time</h3>
            <p>We will review your case and respond within 5 business days to address your concerns.</p>

            <h2>4. Finality of Decisions</h2>
            <h3>4.1. Final and Binding</h3>
            <p>All decisions made by Kaboom Gaming regarding cancellations and refunds are final and binding.</p>

            <h2>5. Governing Law</h2>
            <h3>5.1. Jurisdiction</h3>
            <p>This policy is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of India. Any disputes arising under this policy shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Bengaluru City, India.</p>
